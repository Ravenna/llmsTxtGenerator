        text: "The SaaS umbrella covers websites that are not just a brochure. The types of applications that live under the SaaS umbrella are as diverse as you can imagine. A few examples would be your grocery store's online ordering system, your tax or accounting software like NerdWallet or Quickbooks, or your social media of choice. If you can log in, it's probably SaaS."

A Minimally Viable Product (MVP) is a term used to describe the simplest form of your application you could take to market or open up to a beta test. Getting to an MVP as quickly as possible is crucial in SaaS development. Your users will tell you what they need, and if you get it in their hands faster, you will learn, iterate and offer a superior product.'
