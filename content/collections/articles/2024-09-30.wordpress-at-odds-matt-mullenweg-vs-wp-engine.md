        text: "Hey there! If you are on this website, you've probably heard of WordPress. It powers over 40% of the websites on the internet. Matt Mullenweg co-founded WordPress and is the CEO of Automattic, the company behind WordPress.com. WordPress is open-source and is used by thousands of developers and companies to create websites, which has led to an entire ecosystem of businesses that support it, like WP Engine."

        text: "Recently, a legal drama unfolded between Mullenweg and WP Engine, one of the most prominent managed WordPress hosting companies. And just so we have said it: we have lost count of how many websites we built on WordPress and hosted on WPEngine. If you're unfamiliar with WP Engine, they offer services that help people host their WordPress sites, promising faster speeds, better security, and all that good stuff that makes running a website easier. For a while, it seemed like Automattic and WP Engine existed in a happy WordPress ecosystem. But then, things got a little complicated. Let's dive into the details of this legal feud and unpack what's happening here."

        text: "To understand what's happening, you must understand the delicate balance between open-source software like WordPress and the businesses built around it. WordPress is open-source, meaning anyone can use, modify, and even sell their own versions. That's actually one of the reasons it became so popular. However, even though something is open-source, people will still fight over how it's used."

His company, Automattic, offers commercial services like hosting through WordPress.com, but it maintains a solid commitment to the free software model. This includes Automattic staff spending thousands of hours supporting the open-source community."

They take WordPress, the open-source software, and optimize it for customers, adding layers of support and functionality, for which they charge a premium. For years, it seemed like a symbiotic relationship—WP Engine profited from WordPress, while WordPress benefited from having high-quality hosting services that encouraged more people to use the platform.'

        text: "At the heart of this legal dispute is the issue of trademarks. Automattic owns several trademarks related to WordPress, including the WordPress name and logo. While WordPress as software is open-source, the name and logo are not. Automattic has a strict policy that companies can't use WordPress names in their domain or product names unless they follow specific guidelines. The idea here is to protect the integrity of the WordPress brand while allowing the software to remain free and open."

From WP Engine's perspective, they were doing what every other company in the WordPress ecosystem does: capitalizing on the platform's popularity while providing added value to customers. But Automattic believes that WP Engine's usage went too far and began to infringe on its trademarks, leading to the legal back-and-forth."

Mullenweg has been vocal about his commitment to keeping WordPress open and free, even as his company makes money from hosting and other paid services.'

        text: "However, companies like WP Engine make their living by building on top of WordPress, often adding proprietary features or services to the open-source platform. The line between what is part of the free, open-source WordPress and what is a paid, proprietary add-on can sometimes get blurry. In this case, a specific example of one of Mullenweg's concerns is that WPEngine has removed one of WordPress's core features: the revision log. A revision is saved whenever you change a piece of content in WordPress. This can lead to a larger database over time. One of the ways WPEngine saves money and has changed WordPress is by removing the revision system. To be clear, they will turn it back on for up to three revisions per piece of content, but Mullenweg thinks this is still to large a change."

        text: "For Mullenweg and Automattic, WP Engine has crossed the line. WP Engine, in turn, may feel that Automattic is using its legal power to stifle competition. From an outsider's perspective, it's a classic David and Goliath story: Automattic is a billion-dollar company, and WP Engine, while successful, is still smaller in comparison. But, of course, WP Engine has grown considerably over the years, and that's where the conflict lies."

That could impact smaller companies that offer WordPress-related services and products. On the other hand, if WP Engine successfully defends itself, it could set a precedent for other companies to push the boundaries of what's allowed under the WordPress brand."
