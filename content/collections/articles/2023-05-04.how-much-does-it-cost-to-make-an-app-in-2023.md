To achieve a great brand, working with a professional designer is critical. A professional designer will take you through their process of creating a brand. Several things are essential to creating a brand: mood boards, color palettes, brand tone, and more. Not to mention a brand guide at the end of the process that you share with your team and future designers to keep things on track. Plan on budgeting $10k-$15k here.\_"

Think of wireframes as a minimal pencil drawing of the app layout. Wireframes become a prototype that users can review. With a great set of wireframes, you can transition to user testing and start getting feedback. With software like Figma, we can even make these wireframes partially interactive so that someone can follow a path and test it.'
