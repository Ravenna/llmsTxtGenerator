There are many factors at play with software development. Scope of the project, technical requirements, and more. If you have a budget in mind, share it and we’ll give you an idea of what you can expect to get from that. Or we can go through planning and provide you with a full estimate."

            text: 'There are several ways to keep this from happening. The best place to solve this problem is during the planning and strategy part of a project. Not that every outcome can be planned for, but good planning can save the project in many ways. That said, sometimes things change. A stakeholder changes their perspective, market forces dictate a change or an outside factor that couldn’t be planned for. We will work hard, have integrity, and communicate with you at all times to keep the project on time and within budget.'
