        text: 'Sun Mountain Lodge came to Ravenna with two issues.  First, due to a new site launch, their SEO had taken a massive step backward. Second, the new site was not maintainable.  While it was WordPress, the developer had implemented the CMS in a way that made it very difficult to manage.   The site Also had a very Lighthouse score in the 60s.  '

        text: "Many people complain that WordPress is slow.  Our rebuttal to that argument is simple: Poorly developed or implemented themes are slow, sites with 30 plugins are slow, sites that don't minify assets are slow, and sites that use 1+ MB images are slow. So, let's talk about how we fixed this for Sun Mountain Lodge. "
