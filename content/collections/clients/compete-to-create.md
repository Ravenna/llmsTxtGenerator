        text: 'Ravenna was originally brought on to help improve the Compete to Create (C2C) branding on that third-party platform.  The system was limited in both style and functionality specific to the mindset training needs.  After working with the team at C2C it was determined that a more customized system would be needed to truly offer the level of training they wanted to provide.  '

        text: 'It was important to understand the content of the training in order to recommend a path forward.  The Ravenna team mapped out the 16 principles and reviewed the training videos and content that had been built out over several years.   The goal of discovery was to define a structure for the training modules and identify the types of learning for each. Some of the content was video, some needed quizzes, or reading, others needed the trainee to take some sort of action and report back.'

        text: "Once all of the content was laid out, the next step was to map the user journeys and begin wireframing.  A user in this case was likely to be an employee of a company that had contracted with C2C to offer their employee's mindset training.  The user would get an onboarding email, set a password and then be off on the journey through the training. "
