more_info: "Hey there! I'm looking for someone to revamp website- servicecenter-nearme.com | I'm envisioning a fantastic redesign that takes inspiration from the renowned yellow pages sites. Also the internal brand pages should look attracting containing all regions which are currently listed as categories on the site like Tesla or mobiles. Picture this: a sleek and user-friendly interface that allows visitors to filter results based on city and brands. But that's not all! I want to go above and beyond by incorporating additional features like reviews, complaints, and other options akin to a top-notch directory website. Could you kindly provide me with an estimated cost for this work?"
