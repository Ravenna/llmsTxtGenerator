more_info: "ProNova Partners would like to collaborate with you on the sale of your business ASAP.  Buyer demand is sky-high for our offerings - we closed many of the new engagements we were hired for nationwide in 2022 despite the pandemic and the intial onset of a recession.  Valuations are ridiculous {STILL}, our closing timeframes are short, and the good times I'm afraid won't last forever.  Interest rates will rise eventually, which will make it increasingly harder for Buyers to leverage up & pay 4-9x (PLUS) NET income on the best opportunities, plus there lies the possiblity of long term capital gains taxes on the sale of your business nearly doubling in the future possibly....The time is now!\r\n\r\nWe're starting to see some of our best buyers offering lower multiples of net income b/c debt facilities and terms for lenders just make it harder to lever up and pay us tippity top dollar, which is what we're accustomed to!  ;)\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in selling or just checking in on the valuation of your enterprise, please feel free to reach out to me directly to book an appointment {CONFIDENTIALLY} to explore further:  https://www.calendly.com/pronova\r\n\r\nOn our end - we had 25 closings in 2022, with a dozen more (ranging from $230k to $72MM all-cash) closings scheduled in the next few months and we're running low on salable inventory again.\_ M&A marches onward despite these uncertain times!!\_ \r\n\r\nI'd ideally like to take some time to begin a discussion on the sale of your Company & we can commence 'packaging' this opportunity together so we can hopefully go to market and close by year-end.\_ If you disagree, for whatever reason, hopefully just give me a follow up date that you think makes sense and I can circle back with you at that time.\_ \r\n\r\nBut why ProNova Partners?\r\n\r\n- We have plenty of cash buyers that are active & decisive acquirers for good inventory.  \r\n- We possess the network and the experiences to orchestrate virtually any transaction from initial consultation to the close of escrow in a timely manner.\r\n- We pay for upgraded advertising which in turn ensures maximum exposure to your business far beyond our company database of 32,239+ buyers looking for interesting targets.\r\n- We specialize in highly-sensitive and confidential sales and recognize its importance, therefore all buyers have an NDA on file with us.\r\n- We work together with our highly skilled team to produce top-tier marketing materials and pitch books that impel buyers to write offers.\r\n- We are experts in valuation - by applying the correct valuation strategy to your firm, we can therefore negotiate the highest possible price for your business.\r\n- We understand the importance of time to close, and considering all of the above we also have an average 90 days to close for our buyers / sellers.\r\n- We are a success fee firm, unless we close the transaction for you, there is no charge to you.\r\n\r\nIs your legacy something you want to procrastinate with?  \r\n\r\nOr take some baby steps, 76% of business owners regret their exit after just one year.
