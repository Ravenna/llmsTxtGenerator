I hope you won’t mind spending only 2-3 minutes to have a look at the following lines:\r\n\r\nIt seems you've been spending your budget with a sponsored listing or PPC.\r\n\r\nIn PPC, you may get the sales but only after paying a certain amount every time and if you stop paying, then the sales will vanish soon.\r\n\r\n. In SEO, You need to budget for a few months. Once keywords will be on the first page of Google, you can get satisfied traffic for a long time.\r\n\r\n. 90% of users like Organic results over sponsored ones because these results are more relevant and valuable. So just imagine how many valuable customers you are losing by not focusing on organic search results.\r\n\r\nBy investing a few months in SEO, you can see drastic changes in your website internally and externally. We'll show you TOP Rankings in your keywords, link popularity, organic traffic, and many more...\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing your website, I noticed some major on-page and off-page issues that need to be fixed soon. For more information about your site errors, please respond to my email.\r\n\r\nI would be happy to provide you with a Complete Site Analysis Report (free of cost) with our Company Profile, Work Experience, and Client Testimonials.\r\n\r\nOur main AIM is customer satisfaction. We are not like others. We've limited customers and make sure they are really happy with our performance.\r\n\r\nYou may be interested in Big Big Companies but I can say they're taking money only by showing their company brand to customers; otherwise, the result part is Zero. The decision is yours!\r\n\r\nWe wish you the best of luck and look forward to a long and healthy business relationship with you and your company.\r\n\r\nWaiting for your positive response…\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\nDaniel Jason\r\n--------------------------------------\r\nBusiness Development Manager\r\nNew York 11801, USA\r\n\r\nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: This email, including any attachments, is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.
