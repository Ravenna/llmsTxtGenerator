more_info: "Hi there!\r\n\r\nI’m hoping to inspire current and future business owners to make their businesses more sustainable. \r\n\r\nMy thinking, if you’re interested, is that I can put together a guest article for your website. The article will discuss the most feasible and profitable opportunities available to business owners looking to make a positive environmental impact. Essentially, it will teach readers how to find (and utilize) sustainability-boosting practices for their businesses. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Any interest in sharing this content with your readers?\r\n\r\nAll the best,\r\nBrenda Kirby\r\ngreenstillmatters.com/\r\n\r\n*Reply with “New topics, please,” if you’re open to receiving an article but didn’t like the above suggestion. And just let me know if you don’t wish to hear from me again.*"
