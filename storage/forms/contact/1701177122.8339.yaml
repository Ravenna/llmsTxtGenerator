more_info: "Hello,\r\n\r\nWe created Content Runner, a writing management marketplace out of Seattle, Washington and I would like to discuss how we could work together. I see that your company is in the marketing business and with our ability to set your own price per article, I thought youâ€™d like to try out the writers on our site.\r\n\r\nAccounts are free and I would be willing to give you a $30 credit to test us out, would you be interested in that?\r\n\r\nIf you are not interested, please reply to this email with STOP and we will make sure not to contact you again."
