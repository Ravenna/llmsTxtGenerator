However, many business owners have no idea where or how to find the right professionals who will meet their needs. \r\n\r\nOn that note, can I write a guest article for your site about techniques business owners can use when sourcing marketing talent from beyond their own walls? \r\n\r\nAll the best,\r\nJ. Lovelace\r\nWorkCanWait.net\r\n\r\n\r\n～Interested in an article, just not on the topic I suggested? No problem! Just respond to let me know and we can come up with something else. Or, if you’re not interested in an article at all, just let me know."
